  <h2> My Things To Do </h2>
  <br>
  <p> Here is a list of some of the things I want to do in my life. This is not fully complete as I want to do more and more daily, but these are goals I want to reach that I believe
      are attainable. There are a lot more places I would want to visit, but those are my top few that I would like to visit first. </p>
<br>

          <table>

      <tr>
        <th>  Health Goals  </th>
        <th> Fun Goals </th>
        <th> Events to Attend </th>
        <th> Gaming Goals </th>
        <th> Travelling Goals </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> Be able to push 390 on my legs </td>
        <td> Learn how to play the guitar </td>
        <td> PAX East </td>
        <td> Hit Radiant in Valorant </td>

        <td>Ireland</td>
      </tr>

    </table>

    <p> I have a lot of things I want to do, but these are goals that attain to enjoyable sections of my life. Besides these, I want to be able to engineer products that help
    others live a simpler life and a more accessible one. I also want to be able to travel the world and meet new people and to get to know other cultures and people. These are not
    topics I can include in this table, so I am adding them afterwards.</p>
