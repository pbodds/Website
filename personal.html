            <h2> Personal Projects</h2>

      <p>Here you can find some of the things I am currently working on. As of right now I am not working on much, but in the future I may start to take up more activities. <a href="https://github.com/pbodds"> My GitHub </a> </p>

      <h3>Learning Python </h3>
      <p>I am currently trying to learn Python alone and to get a firm understanding of how to use it. I know Java, so learning it is not that hard, but its the differences in what they can do that I need to adapt to.</p>

      <h3> Building a bot </h3>
      <p> This is under development with my roomate, we are working on a bot together for an application called Discord. </p>

      <h3> Building this website </h3>
      <p> Building this website is probably one of the harder things I will do, as I have no knowledge of front end development and there is so much to change and to edit. For me, it feels super cluttered and like there is something more I need to do.</p>

      <h3> Automating my lights </h3>
      <p> This one can be done with a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino, to recieve communication from my phone or computer to toggle the power on for the lights. </p>

      <h3> Making my own Christmas lights </h3>
      <p> This I have to do more research on, but I will need to solder some lights together and to make sure they work and I might use an Arduino or something to program the different spectrum of the lights and what they can do.</p>
