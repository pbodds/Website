            <p>This is my basic portfolio and background information. This is still being updated as I learn more and more, and go through different experiences.
                I have a total of 5 co-op opportunities so those will be added, and the format of my portfolio is also destined to change. Technical skill-wise I
                feel most comfortable with networking, hardware, OSX, and backend programming languages (most comfortable with Java). The only other material I can add to this section
                would be classes I have taken in the past. Most of my classes have been computer oriented, either dealing with coding or hardware. Before I transferred my Sophomore year to
                Cincinnati, I took business classes that had a background of computer systems as my college did not offer technical classes.</p>
